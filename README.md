World Population Prediction
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting the world population by 2030 using historical population data from the World Bank. The project employs a simple linear regression model to analyze and forecast future population trends.

Overview
This project includes the following key steps:

Data Loading: Authentic historical world population data from the World Bank.
Data Cleaning: Inspecting and cleaning the dataset to handle missing values and ensure data quality.
Feature Extraction: Extracting relevant features (Year) and target variable (Population).
Model Training: Using linear regression to train the model on the historical data.
Evaluation: Calculating evaluation metrics including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R²) to assess the model performance.
Prediction: Predicting the world population for the year 2030.
Visualization: Plotting the historical data, regression line, and 2030 prediction for visual analysis.

Data Source
The historical world population data is sourced from the World Bank https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL.

Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
R-squared (R²)
Results
The model predicts the world population in 2030.
Visualization includes a scatter plot of historical data, the regression line, and the 2030 prediction.
